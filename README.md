# Spor Labs

**Spor Labs** is a developer-focused research and software engineering collective building modular tools for infrastructure, deployment, and automation. We specialize in lightweight, self-hostable technologies designed to serve small MSPs, homelab enthusiasts, and independent developers.

### What We Build

- **Deployment Tools** â€“ Applications for automated configuration and device provisioning (e.g., Autopilot workflows).
- **Infrastructure Platforms** â€“ Modular, Proxmox-compatible systems for app hosting and DevOps (e.g., `Spor.OS`, `VoidPanel`).
- **Admin Dashboards** â€“ Web-based portals for internal client communications and content distribution (e.g., company intranet platforms).
- **Cross-Platform Applications** â€“ Tools developed using .NET MAUI, Blazor, and modern frontend technologies.

### Guiding Themes

- **Self-hosted First**
- **MSP and SMB Friendly**
- **Cross-platform and Modular**
- **Lightweight by Design**
- **Open-source where possible**

This organization serves as the central repository for all current and future projects under the Spor Labs name. Each repository includes documentation, project-specific READMEs, and relevant deployment instructions.
